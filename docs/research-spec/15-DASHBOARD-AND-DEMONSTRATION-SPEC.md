# SPRINT 11 SPECIFICATION: DASHBOARD, RAW ALERT INVESTIGATION & DETERMINISTIC DEMONSTRATION LAYER

## 1. Architectural Overview

Sprint 11 introduces the complete operator and investigation layer on top of the validated S1–S9 research runtime and S10 pre-deployment foundation.

The primary capabilities added in this sprint are:
1. **RawAlertEvidenceStore**: Immutable SQLite persistence layer for full raw alert evidence, written strictly *before* core RBTA mutation during ingestion.
2. **RBTAEngine Observability**: Pure read-only snapshot methods (\snapshot_agents()\, \snapshot_buckets()\) enabling zero-mutation visibility into per-agent EMA adaptation and active bucket states.
3. **REST Dashboard APIs**: Secure, authenticated endpoints providing KPIs, time series reduction, agent/bucket introspection, paginated MetaAlert lists, raw alert member resolution, and single-alert forensic JSON view.
4. **Deterministic ReplayController**: Background playback engine with speed throttling, pause/resume/stop/reset controls, session isolation, and deterministic execution.
5. **Modern Single-Page Application (SPA)**: Cloudflare-inspired infrastructure dashboard built with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and TanStack Query.
6. **Multi-Stage Docker Packaging**: Multi-stage build producing an all-in-one container serving the SPA from FastAPI alongside REST endpoints with SPA fallback routing.

## 2. Research Integrity & Invariant Preservation

Sprint 11 operates strictly under the locked research invariants:
- **Zero Alert Drops**: All valid incoming events are preserved without timestamp or watermark drops.
- **Evidence-Before-Mutation Order**: Raw alert evidence is persisted to the SQLite store prior to mutating the RBTA aggregation bucket.
- **Authoritative Backend Calculation**: The frontend never calculates ARR, feature normalization, anomaly scores, or quadrant decisions.
- **Idempotency**: Duplicate alerts identified by \wazuh_alert_id\ are safely deduplicated in the evidence store via \INSERT OR IGNORE\.

## 4. Verification Suite

The S11 implementation is verified by 271 unit and integration tests covering:
- Raw alert persistence, idempotency, search filters, and partial resolution.
- RBTAEngine snapshot correctness across empty and active states.
- FastAPI dashboard route governance, auth validation, and pagination.
- Deterministic replay lifecycle, state transitions, and thread safety.
- Complete regression across all prior sprint test suites (S1–S10).
